# Ice_Videogames

---
The online store "Ice" sells video games all over the world and has compiled data with user and expert reviews, genres, platforms (for example, Xbox or PlayStation) and historical data on game sales over the years. 2016. 
The objective of this project is to identify patterns that determine whether a game is successful or not for sale. This will allow us to detect promising projects and plan advertising campaigns for the following year (2017).

To achieve the objective, the data received will be prepared, then analyzed in order to create a user profile for each of the relevant regions (North America, the European Union and Japan). Additionally, we will seek to answer the following hypotheses:
1. Average user ratings for Xbox One and PC platforms are the same.
2. Average user ratings for Action and Sports genres are different.
